Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are software intermediaries that enable two applications to communicate. Many biomedical knowledge bases and software tools support API access. We have compiled all API cards collected by students in BioInfo 201-Winter, 2022, UCLA class, conducted by Pinglab UCLA , as their class project into a unified document. The goal of this project is to: Learn which APIs are available for biomedical knowledge, software tools, or datasets, and how they can be accessed. Describe how these APIs can be leveraged for omics-related data analysis workflows. Each API card document is prepared by a group of students which includes: Title Description Use Cases Tutorials A Sample API Card Following is a sample API card prepared by instructors on Uniprot API. We encourage students to follow the similar pattern and add more information (e.g., cheat sheet, citations, supporting papers) if needed and available. Title: UniProt Web API Description: UniProt is a protein knowledge base which provides information on proteins, including their sequences, their biological function, and other properties, curated from their references in the biomedical literature. UniProt can be accessed directly at uniprot.org and instructions to the API are detailed at online API document . Use cases: Retrieve individual or batch entries of proteins of interest (e.g., the text representation of a protein entry, parsable by a custom script, given at a text file Convert database identifiers (e.g., If a collaborator gave you protein IDs from another knowledgebase such as STRING DB but your software uses UniProt IDs. You want your software to convert these to UniProt so you can run your analysis properly. You can use UniProt\u2019s web API described here to convert these IDs.) Tutorial: We encourage students to create a Google Colab jupyter notebook as a tutorial with necessary code to illustrate the use of API with some tasks. Here we provide a smaple tutorial for Uniprot API.

Task: Given a scRNA-seq data set with rare cell types, identify the marker genes Background: To better understand rare cell types, we can identify genes that are distinct in their gene expression profile Goal: Identify marker genes for rare cell types Method: API pipeline with some downsampling to balance class sizes Outcome: Marker genes for rare cell types Task: Given a scRNA-seq data set with rare cell types, construct a trajectory mapping the relationships between all cell types Background: To better understand rare cell types, we can look at their ontological frame with respect to other cell types mapped in some embedding space Goal: Append rare cell types to lineage tree of more common cell types Method: API pipeline with a separate projection of rare cell types to embedding after initial trajectory construction Outcome: Cell type trajectory","title":"Scanpy"},{"location":"scanty/#scanpy-api","text":"","title":"Scanpy API"},{"location":"scanty/#explored-by","text":"HUANG, HELEN , MATTHEWS, JAMIE EMOTO , PERRIE, JONATHAN VI - (Bioinformatics 201, Winter-2022, UCLA)","title":"Explored by:"},{"location":"scanty/#description","text":"Scanpy is a general purpose API for various components of the single-cell analysis pipeline; these include: Filtering Low-dimensional Embeddings Clustering Marker gene identification Plotting It can be accessed via the website documentation , and the original paper can be found on Genome Biology at this link .","title":"Description:"},{"location":"scanty/#tutorial","text":"we created a simple tutorial covering some of these functions for a scRNA-seq dataset, which can be accessed at this link .
