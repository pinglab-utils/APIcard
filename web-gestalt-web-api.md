## API: WebGestalt web API

#### Explored by: Huang Huiling


### Description: 

WebGestalt is a gene set enrichment analysis tool which helps users interpret lists
of interesting genes or proteins from high-throughput experiment results in various biological
contexts. The tool supports three complementary methods for enrichment analysis, including
Over-Representation Analysis (ORA), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and Network
Topology-based Analysis (NTA). Various functional databases and reference gene sets are
available, and users can upload their own choice of reference set. WebGestalt can be accessed
directly at http://www.webgestalt.org/, and the user manual of the API is detailed at
http://www.webgestalt.org/WebGestalt_2019_Manual.pdf.


### Use cases:

- Retrieve gene set data files of interest (e.g., retrieve the human gene set files in KEGG
database for pathway analysis)
- Retrieve gene set enrichment analysis results (e.g., perform gene set enrichment
analysis of a specific list of genes with specified organism, enrichment method, FDR
method, enrichment database category, enrichment database name, statistically
significant method, significant value, maximum number of genes for a category, ID type
of the gene list and reference set)
