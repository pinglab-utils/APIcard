### Description:

The GWAS catalog was initiated by the National Human Genome Resource Institute to
enable access to published GWA studies. These studies are identified by literature search
by curators, who then extract trait information with relevant SNPs and metadata. Summary
statistics and other various analyses are also made available. The GWAS catalog has its
own REST API but returns data in a hierarchical JSON format.
Gwasrapidd is an R package that provides the first client interface to the GWAS Catalog
REST API, allowing users to bypass this JSON format to get data in a more tabular fashion.
It enables users to quickly retrieve, filter and integrate data with comprehensive
bioinformatics analysis tools, which is particularly critical for those looking into functional
characterization of risk loci.

### Use cases:

- Query GWAS database using a variety of criteria:
- Study access identifier for a particular GWAS
- Risk allele ID (RSID) for a particular allele
- Broader experimental factor ontology (EFO) traits
- Based on existing queries, identify related traits and associations
- Set operations to manage and filter queries
