### Description: 

UCSC Genome Browser is an interactive website hosted by the
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). It provides biomedical researchers with
genome sequence and annotation data from major model organisms include human,
mouse, fruit fly e.g. Online graphical viewer can be accessed at
https://genome.ucsc.edu/ , the usage of API are detailed as
https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/api.html


### Use cases:

- Extract the nucleotide sequence from human genome according to its
genomic coordinates
- Extract genes (annotations) from given regions of the human genome
- Extract expression of transcript variants at given regions of the human
genome
- Extract SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) from given regions of the
human genome
