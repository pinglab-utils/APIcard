### Description: 

The cBioportal for Cancer Genomics is an open-access, open-source
resource for interactive exploration and visualization of multidimensional cancer
genomics data sets. cBioPortal can be accessed directly at
https://www.cbioportal.org . Instructions to cBioportal can be found at
https://www.cbioportal.org/tutorials#webinar-1.


### Use Cases:

-  Retrieve microarray data to determine cancer mutations across multiple
patients and studies
-  Utilize data for for own local visualizations
-  Cross reference different mutations to determine common genotypes
-  Use mutations in Conjunction with Clinical Data to predict Disease
Outcomes
