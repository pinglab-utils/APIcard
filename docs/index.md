# API Card


Welcome to API card collection!

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are software intermediaries that enable two applications to communicate. Many biomedical knowledge bases and software tools support API access. 

We have compiled all API cards collected by students in **BioInfo 201-Winter, 2022, UCLA** class, conducted by **Pinglab UCLA**, as their class project into a unified document. The goal of this project is to: 

- Learn which APIs are available for biomedical knowledge, software tools, or datasets, and how they can be accessed.
- Describe how these APIs can be leveraged for omics-related data analysis workflows.

Each API card document is prepared by a group of students which includes:

- Title
- Description
- Use Cases
- Tutorials

## A Sample API Card

Following is a sample API card prepared by instructors on Uniprot API. We encourage students to follow the similar pattern and add more information (e.g., cheat sheet, citations, supporting papers) if needed and available.

### Title: UniProt Web API

#### Description: 

UniProt is a protein knowledge base which provides information on proteins, including their sequences, their biological function, and other properties, curated from their references in the biomedical literature. UniProt can be accessed directly at
[uniprot.org](https://www.uniprot.org/) and instructions to the API are detailed at [online API document](https://www.uniprot.org/help/programmatic_access).



#### Use cases:

- Retrieve individual or batch entries of proteins of interest (e.g., the text representation of a protein entry, parsable by a custom script, given at [a text file](https://uniprot.org/uniprot/P12345.txt)

- Convert database identifiers (e.g., If a collaborator gave you protein IDs from another
knowledgebase such as STRING DB but your software uses UniProt IDs. You want your
software to convert these to UniProt so you can run your analysis properly. You can use
UniProtâ€™s web API described here to convert these IDs.)


#### Tutorial: 

We encourage students to create a Google Colab jupyter notebook as a tutorial with necessary code to illustrate the use of API with some tasks. Here we provide a smaple tutorial for Uniprot API.
