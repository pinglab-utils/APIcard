### Description: 
PTC is a Web application that gives automatic annotations of biomedical concepts
(mutations, genes, diseases, drugs, diseases) extracted from PMC articles and PubMed
abstracts. PTC can be accessed at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/index.html
and instructions and examples for usage can be located at
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/api.html.


### Use cases:

-  Retrieve all annotations for each PubMed abstract e.g. You want to get biomedical text
training data for named-entity recognition tasks where you need the full-text and the
corresponding annotations/labels.
- Identify key genes related to a certain disease
  - Want to perform a literature review to search for important genes related to
  breast cancer
  - Rank genes by number of publications
  - Retrieve abstracts from highest published gene
